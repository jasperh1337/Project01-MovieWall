# Project01-MovieWall
FInal project files. If the driver isn't working when using the file input for the CSV file, may need to hard code in the file path on the local computer for it to run.

The runtime of the whole file should vary from n^2 to n depending on how the searches go. For the most part I believe it should be n^2 to be realistic
The reason is because the binary search will definitely take a very long time to search especially since we have a plethora of actors to get through. 
Additionally, the sorting method I tried to use called SortingStuff wasn't working to how I want so the actorList isn't sorted. 
Space complexity should be constant, in the sense that once all the CSV columns are put into their proper columns, no additional space is needed to be made for the project to work. 
movieDetails & sortingStuff are thrown in here because those two files are originally used to help make everything in the project more organized. 
I sadly couldn't get those to work, especialyl sortingStuff due to errors in the code that I don't have enough time to fix to make runtime shorter. 
The rest of the explanations for the code are inside the actual classes and files with brief descriptions of how they work.
